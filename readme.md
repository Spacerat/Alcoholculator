# Alcoholculator

You walk in to the liquor store with the single-minded desire to get the most alcohol for your money, but it's not as easy as it sounds. That six-pack of beer for £4 at 4.3% ABV looks pretty good, but this 70cl bottle of vodka for £15 seems pretty good too! Oh and then there's the wine... if only there were a website to help you juggle all the numbers.

### Inner workings
Alcoholculator is a [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) project which I threw together mostly as a learning exercise. Yep, that was totally definitely the reason I made a binge drinking tool.

To host it yourself, just serve `index.html` and the `static` directory with a static server. To run the hot-reloadable dev environment:

    $ npm install
    $ npm start
